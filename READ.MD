# Anki Importing Formats

This repository follows a strict format for importing cards into Anki:
- **basic.csv**: Contains standard Q&A cards.
- **cloze.csv**: Contains cloze deletion cards.

Each deck has its own folder. Some existing decks might not follow these standards, but future updates will standardize all decks.
